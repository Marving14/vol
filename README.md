# Time to Collision Estimation Function Documentation

## Objective
The objective of this function is to estimate the time to collision (TTC) between an ego vehicle and a vehicle in front of it, considering both vehicles' velocities and accelerations.

## Problem Statement
Given the initial velocities and accelerations of both the ego vehicle and the front vehicle, along with the initial distance between them, the function calculates the time at which the distance between the two vehicles will be zero, indicating a potential collision.

## Approach
The solution involves calculating the relative motion between the two vehicles. This is achieved by determining the relative velocity and acceleration and using these to predict when the vehicles might occupy the same position.

### Relative Motion Equations
Relative velocity is the difference in velocity between the ego vehicle and the front vehicle. Relative acceleration is the difference in their accelerations.

The motion equation is:
\[ s = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \]

Where:
- \( s \) is the distance between the vehicles,
- \( v_0 \) is the relative initial velocity,
- \( a \) is the relative acceleration,
- \( t \) is the time.

### Solving for Time
The time \( t \) when the distance \( s \) becomes zero is found by solving the quadratic equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} a t^2 + v_0 t - s = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

### Handling Different Scenarios
- If the discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) is negative, the vehicles will not collide as they are moving apart.
- If the discriminant is zero, there is one point of contact, and the time to collision is calculated accordingly.
- If the discriminant is positive, the smallest positive root is the time to collision.
- If the calculated time to collision is negative, it indicates that the vehicles are moving apart, and no collision will occur.

## Implementation
The `calculate_ttc_with_acceleration` function in Python handles the TTC calculation. It returns the time to collision if a collision is possible, or a message indicating that no collision is possible otherwise.

### Test Cases
The function is tested with various scenarios, including:
- Basic cases with both vehicles accelerating.
- Cases where the ego vehicle is catching up to a decelerating front vehicle.
- Scenarios where vehicles are moving apart, and no collision is possible.

The results from these test cases confirm the function's accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion
The updated `calculate_ttc_with_acceleration` function offers a precise and reliable method for estimating the time to collision between two vehicles under uniform acceleration. This enhanced function is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving systems and collision avoidance technologies.
